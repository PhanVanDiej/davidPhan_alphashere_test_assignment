# How to Configure Multi-Factor Authentication with your OptiSigns account.

Nowadays, digital security is critical in the world because both businesses and users store sensitive information online. You can set up Multi-Factor Authentication with your OptiSigns account. This increases your account's security.  
  
**Important Note:**

* The authentication App feature is for **ALL** subscription plans.
* The SMS feature is only for Pro Plus and can only take **US numbers**.
* An email is required for MFA so this feature will not be available for users with a **username** as a login.

## **Let's jump in and get started:**

You can set up the Two-factor Authentication on the Personal Profile page: <https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/personal-profile>
