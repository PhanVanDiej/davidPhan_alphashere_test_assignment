# How to lock objects or part of the Designer Templates (lockable templates)

Have you ever had to make a quick change on your template, but accidentally move other objects that you did not want to move, which causes you to fix everything or undo it? Or, do you have a requirement set that normal users can only edit certain parts of the design (e.g., pricing portion, or promo picture portion)?

In OptiSigns Designer, you can use the "Lock" tool. This lets you lock elements, which stops users from editing, moving, change scaling, and rotating objects.

Only the **Owner or Admin** can Lock/Unlock objects by clicking on Lock/Unlock button.

Other roles do not support Lock/Unlock objects, they can see but can't click the Unlock button.

* To select Multiple Objects, hold **Shift + Left Click**
* When selecting multiple objects:
  + Selected objects do not have any locked objects, then click the Lock button, and all selected objects would be locked.
  + Selected objects have one or more locked objects, and all selected objects cannot be moved, scaled, or rotated. When clicking the Unlock button, the locked objects will be unlocked.

### That's it!
