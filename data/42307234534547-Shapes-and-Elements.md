### Link

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307234471443)

Selecting the **Link** option will allows you to turn your shape or element into a hyperlink. It will open the **Link Options** section on the Side Menu:

Clicking **Add Link** will prompt you to enter a URL or select an asset:

Once a link or asset has been chosen, more options will appear in the Link Options section:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307250842003)

Expanding the **Scale** section will provide this option for your asset:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307234474131)

Here, choose how the image will be scaled. There are three options:

* **Fit (default)** - Fits the image to the screen.
* **Stretch** - Stretches the image to fill the entire screen.
* **Zoom** - Zooms in on the image to fill up the entire screen. Not recommended for small images on large displays, as this will create blurriness.

| **NOTE** |
| If a URL is provided, the **Scale** option will not appear. Only selecting a File/Asset will provide this option. |

Expanding the **Settings** section will provide these options for your URL or Asset:

* **Duration (seconds) -** When the link is clicked or tapped, how long the link or asset will display before returning to the main design.
* **Preload** **-** When checked, the website or image will load when the design does. This reduces the amount of time it takes for the website to pop up when the link is clicked. However, having numerous links needing to load may cause lag.

Expanding the **Close & Nav Bar Styler** section will provide these options for your URL or Asset:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307250845203)

This section refers to the button that will appear on your screens when it is pushed to them. Clicking or tapping this button will return you back to the original design.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307234479891)

* **Icon Position -** Shows where this icon will appear. Defaults toBottom Center, but can be placed anywhere along the top or bottom, or turned off entirely.

* **Icon Color** - Change the hexadecimal HTML color of the icon to better fit your design.
* **Background Color -** Change the hexadecimal HTML color of the icon background to better fit your design.
* **Opacity** - Slider allows you to change how opaque or transparent the icon background is.

Hitting **Make Data Mapping** allows you to make the selected shape or element dynamic, mapped to one of your existing DataSources. See our article on [**Dynamic DataSources with OptiSync**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/29217646663187-How-to-Set-Up-Dynamic-Data-Mapping-with-OptiSync)for more information.

### Effects

Selecting the **Effects** option allows you to change a number of different aspects of your shape or element. It will open the **Effects** section on the Side Menu:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307250850835)

Here, you have numerous options. We’ll go over each of them in turn.

Expanding the **Color** section allows you to add color to the shape or element.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307234485395)

This is functionally the same as the Colors option in the Shapes and Elements Top Menu. Here, choose between preset colors, colors already used in this design, or through the **Color Picker** option.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307250852115)

Expanding the **Background** section allows you to set a specific background color for the Shape or Element to sit on.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307234487827)

This, too, is functionally the same as the Background option in the Shapes and Elements Top Menu. Here, choose between preset colors, colors already used in this design, or through the **Color Picker** option:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307250853011)

Expanding the **Opacity** section allows you to vary the opacity of the selected area - background and shape/element.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307234489107)

This can be adjusted to a slider. Shown below is half opacity:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307234490131)

|  |
| --- |
| **NOTE** |
| The **Opacity** slider applies to the ***entire selected element*** as opposed to just the shape or background. To change the Opacity of the shape or background, do so through the color picker. |

Expanding the **Outline** section allows you to add an outline to the shape or element, but not the background.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307234493331)

You can select a color from a dropdown or use hexadecimal HTML, and use the slider to change its thickness:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307234494355)

Expanding the **Shadow** section allows you to create a shadow across your shape or element. By default, all the sliders will be white.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307250860563)

Applying a color will create a shadow:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307234497683)

Changing the sliders allows you to change the blur and offset the shadow along the X or Y axis.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307234499987)

With a transparent background, the shadow applies only to the shape or element itself:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307250867731)

Expanding the **Gradient** section will present several gradient options for your shape or element. Clicking any of these Gradient options will apply it to your shape or element.

Expanding the **Texture** section will present several texture options for your shape or element. Clicking any of these texture options will apply them to your shape or element.

![firefox_nrvQ9Z2BcO.gif](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307250871187)

### Position

### Lock & Copy Style

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307250878867)

Hitting the **Lock** button will lock the selected shape or element in place, preventing any changes being made to it.

![firefox_bccFVNuKyj.gif](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307250880019)

This is useful when dealing with many elements after getting the shape or element exactly where you want it.

The **Copy Style** button allows you to quickly apply the style of the selected shape or element to another.

![firefox_xboj1OuX6q.gif](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42307234513683)
