* Name: Name of your Dropbox App, this is the name of the wall in your asset list. It will **not** be displayed on your screens.
* Transition Effect: Transition effect between your images, videos in the folder.
* Transition Speed: How fast you want your transitions to animate.
* Duration for Image: How long each images should show on your screen, default is 10 seconds.
* Max Video Duration: Default is 0, which means the app will play each video till the end. You can set it to some other values to prevent too long videos. For example if you set this value to 60 seconds. If a video is longer than 60s, it will get cut off at 60s to play next item. If a video is less than 60s, it will play the duration of the video.

Click Save.  
Depend on how many files you have in the folders, **it may take a moment** to sync to OptiSigns, as all the files will be synced, copied to our servers.

Files will be sorted and played by name. You can control the order of playback by changing the name of the files in your Dropbox.

**Limitations:**

* Only image and video files are supported. If there are other files in the folder, they will be ignored.
* To ensure good performance of the app, max size is limit at 100MB per file, and max number of files supported in folder is 200. If you have big video files, it's better to upload directly to OptiSigns; and if you have more than 200 files, you can split them up in multiple Dropbox folders.
* The Dropbox app with Teams features requires a workaround to use properly, as it uses a different API from personal accounts. To get around this limitation:
  + **Create a personal folder** within your Dropbox account and upload your content there. You should then be able to create and access it within the **OptiSigns portal**.
