Windows and Raspberry Pi don't support the RTSP HTML5 directly. Before you create the RTSP Stream app, you will need to transcode RTSP to HTTP. Then you can implement RTSP live streaming on the Windows and Raspberry Pi devices. The easy way of achieving RTSP HTML5 playback on Windows and Raspberry Pi is to embed VLC into the HTML5 webpage and adopt it as an HTML5 RTSP player.

### **Let's jump in and get started:**

#### **1. How to use it on Windows and Raspberry Pi devices.**

Before setting up, you will need to prepare:

1. Need the VLC Media Player. You can download it [here](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html).
2. RTSP URL. (Here is an example: rtsp://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net/vod/mp4:BigBuckBunny\_115k.mp4)

Then you can follow these steps to set it up.

Step 1. Launch VLC Media Player, go to the "**Media**" > **Open Network Stream**
