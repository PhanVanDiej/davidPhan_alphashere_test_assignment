# How to use a PDF with OptiSigns

There are 3 ways you can use a PDF file:

* Assign it directly to a screen as an asset
* Put it in a playlist
* Put it in a schedule

### If you're using a PDF directly as an asset on the screen:

You'll need to enter a duration (10 pages, if you enter 200s, each page will be 20s)![](/attachments/token/IZoaFRKd7k98GJXJ7VxJtvvd9/?name=inline-118732892.png)​

### If you're using PDF file in a Playlist:

The item duration is the duration for the document (i.e. 200s and the doc has 10 pages, each page will be displayed for 20s).

### If you are using it in a schedule and assign the PDF as a scheduled asset:

You'll need to enter a duration, like a single asset (10 pages, if you enter 200s, each page will be 10s).

### Troubleshoot:

There are many different versions and ways that a PDF can be generated. So, sometimes you will experience issues with PDF playback.

In general, PDFs generated by Google Docs, Slides, Microsoft Office applications, or Adobe applications will play fine.

Sometimes, PDFs that are too large can have issues. In that case, you can convert the PDF to Images and use it that way.
