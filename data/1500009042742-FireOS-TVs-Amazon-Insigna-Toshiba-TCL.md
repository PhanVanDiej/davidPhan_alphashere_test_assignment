# FireOS TVs (Amazon, Insigna, Toshiba, TCL)

| As of Feb 2024, FireStick and Fire TV are **no longer recommended** as digital signage player. This is due to **[Amazon eliminating the ability to auto start app](https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-blocks-long-running-fire-tv-capability-breaking-popular-apps-with-no-warning-and-giving-developers-the-runaround/)** with FireStick & Fire TVs starting FireOS 8. |

There are workarounds with [ADB commands](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/23274673797139) or manually to start the app.

However, those workarounds are inconvenient, and we believe without an easy way to AutoStart apps, it is not a good solution for a Digital Signage player.

If you have older model of TVs with Amazon FireOS 7 or lower, you can continue with this article to get it set up.

## **Here are the high level steps:**

1) Download OptiSigns Digital Signage from Amazon App Store

2) Using OptiSigns' web portal to assign content and remotely manage your screens

So let's dive in!

### **1) Download & Set up OptiSigns Digital Signage from Amazon App Store**

Press the **Search** icon on the **Find** section of the Fire TV,

Type in "OptiSigns".  
Fire TV Search can be tricky to use, and search as you type sometimes does not work properly.  
After you typed "optisigns", be sure to press the menu down button until the "Optisigns" text is highlighted and then click on it.

Once the app is installed, **launch** it.

The app will ask if you want to automatically start when device start up. It recommended to select **yes**, unless you want to launch the app yourself every time manually.

You then will see this pairing screen:
