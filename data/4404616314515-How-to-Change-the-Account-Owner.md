# How to Change the Account Owner

Account Owner is a special role. Only Account Owners can request deletion of accounts.  
There's only 1 Owner per account.

You can change owner to another user/admin in OptiSigns by:

* Go to the [Account Member](https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/account-members) page:
* Click the **Change Role** icon on the user or admin that you want to change to Owner.
