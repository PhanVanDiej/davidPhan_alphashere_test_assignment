# Assign content to your screens

Once you get screens added, you can start assigning, updating the content, or scheduling the content it plays.  
The steps below are for you to assign a playlist, but you can follow the same process to assign any assets or schedules. You can also schedule your content to go live.

### 1) Assign content to your screen

To assign the playlist to your screen:Â Go to the **Screen** tab.

* **Schedule go-live time**:
  + Set a time when you want the screens to start playing this content. The screen(s) will play this content from this time onward.
