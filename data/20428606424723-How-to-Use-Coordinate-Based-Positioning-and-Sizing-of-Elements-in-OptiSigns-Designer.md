* **Left** - Input a numeric value to specify the horizontal position of the selected element within your canvas.
  + By entering a numerical value, you can specify a numerical value to determine how far the element is positioned from the left side of the canvas.
* **Top** - Input a numeric value to specify the vertical position of the selected element within your canvas.
  + By entering a numerical value, you can specify a numerical value to determine how far the element is positioned from the top edge of the canvas.
* **Width** - This option lets you define the horizontal size, or width, of the selected element.
  + You can input a numerical value to specify how wide the element should be.
* **Height** - This option allows you to set the vertical size of the selected element.
  + By entering a numerical value, you determine how tall the element should be.
* **Maintain Aspect Ratio link (for images or graphical elements only)** - This feature is a convenient tool for maintaining the original proportions of the selected element while adjusting its width and height.
  + When activated (with the link set to "Vertical," as shown above), changing one dimension (width or height) will automatically adjust the other dimension to preserve the aspect ratio.
  + This ensures that the element doesn't become distorted when resized.

## **That's all!**
