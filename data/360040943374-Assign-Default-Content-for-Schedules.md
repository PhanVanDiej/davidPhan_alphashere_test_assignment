# Assign Default Content for Schedules

If you create a schedule, at times when there's no content scheduled, the display will default to a black screen.  
For example the schedule below, at 7AM the screen will just display a black screen.  
Sometime, you would want to set a default content so that when nothing is scheduled the default content will be displayed.

There are 2 ways you can setup defaults content:

1. At the schedule level (apply to a schedule only). To do so, click on the Schedule you want to edit, then click Option.

* **None:**just a black screen when nothing is scheduled
* **Use Account Default:** using what set at account level (see #2 below for how).
* **Asset:** select and asset to be displayed when nothing is scheduled
* **Playlist:** select a playlist to be played when nothing is scheduled

2. Or at Account level so it will apply to all **newly created schedule.** (In case you both at account level and at schedule level, the schedule level setting will take priority for that schedule).
