In Designer, the **Your Temp** (short for “Your Templates”) tab allows you to save and reuse your created templates across multiple designs.

For more general information on the Designer app, see our[**Getting Started in Designer**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/42087942047379-Getting-Started-with-Designer)guide.

This feature can be accessed from the Side Menu within Designer:

Within this tab, there are two options: **Templates** and **Components.**

* **Templates** allows you to save the current design as a Custom Template for use in later designs. This saves the ***entire design*** as a template.
* **Components** allows you to save a selected component (be that text, image, shape, widget, etc.) as a custom component for use in later designs. This saves ***just the selected component*** as a template.

Below, we’ll cover how to save and store these custom templates and give examples of how they can be used.

## Saving and Using Custom Templates

The **Templates** tab has one option when you first open it: **Add Current Design as Template**. Nothing needs to be selected in order to use this.

Clicking this will bring a popup asking you to confirm your choice. Click **Add**. This saves whatever you have on the current design as a Custom Template, shared across your team.

To use this template, simply click on it from the Side Menu:

## Saving and Using Custom Components

The **Components** tab has one option when you first open it: **Add Current Selection as Component**. A component on the current design needs to be selected for this to be used.
