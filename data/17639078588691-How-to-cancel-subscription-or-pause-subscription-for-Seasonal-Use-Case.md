# How to cancel subscription or pause subscription for Seasonal Use Case

With OptiSigns, customers paying via credit card have the capability to manage the subscription update in their account. Customers can decrease or increase your subscription as needed. Customers can go to the subscription update page to cancel the subscription or pause the subscription (reducing the number of subscriptions to 0), this will stop future charges on the account. This will help customers who are using the services seasonally or customers who want to cancel the subscription but would still like to keep the account and contents available as they may restart the subscription in the future.

Our "**Onhold**" folder reduces the number of screen licenses that are being counted as using subscription. This allows you to have new screens added without buying a new screen license. This also allows you to cancel your subscription without having to remove your screens from your OptiSigns account.

A new folder called "**Onhold Device**" will be created and your device will be moved in there.

* Devices in the OnHold screen cannot have content assigned to them, it will just display "Paired" on the screen.
* OnHold screens also do not take up subscription slots, so you can reduce them or reuse them for another screen.

**2)** When you want to use the screen again, you can move it out of OnHold to another Folder

**3)** *If this is a seasonal use case and the main goal for using our "Onhold" folder is to not be billed when your screens are not in use:* **You MUST remember to also remove the licenses under your OptiSigns account.**

If this isn't completed, you may be charged for these licenses.

On the top right-hand side click on your **username (Default)**, **Subscription plan**, and **Update subscription**.

This will display your account subscription details.
