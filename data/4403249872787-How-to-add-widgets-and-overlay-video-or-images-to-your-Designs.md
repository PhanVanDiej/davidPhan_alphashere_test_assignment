The Format Option panel will show up on the right side of the screen.

You can adjust settings for the widget. With Weather: you can adjust location, style, font, color, background etc.

In this case, we just want a simple weather widget so we select Plain style, and make the Opacity 0%. You will have a widget like below.

Then you can **resize** by adjusting the corners and move it to the desired location by drag and dropping it.

This action will snap the video to the canvas size, making it the background for your design. You can then place other widgets and elements on top of the video, creating a layered, dynamic display that enhances the visual appeal of your content.

### That's it! you have added a weather widget to your design.

Weather information on the design will be kept up to date when it's displayed on the screens.
