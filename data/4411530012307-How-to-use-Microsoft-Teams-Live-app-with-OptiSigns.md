**Important Note:** If you are utilizing the OptiSigns Android Stick kindly ensure that the Live Meeting is set to **public**. If your preference is to have the Teams Live Meeting set to "**Sign-in required**," it is recommended to consider using the Windows or Linux device.

That's it!

Now you can assign this MS Teams Live app to your screens, or put it on a schedule so the screens will join automatically when the event start.

**Tips:**

Have the host start the event a few mins before screens are joining automatically.  
It will take a device 10-15s to join the event, so it's not a good idea to put the MS Teams Live in a playlist. It's better to use it as single asset to take up full screen or be part of a [SplitScreen zone](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573).
