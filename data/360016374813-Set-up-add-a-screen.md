#### **1) Set up & add a screen**

First, you need to download the OptiSigns app running on your player Android, Fire TV, Windows, Linux, etc. You can download the app [here](https://www.optisigns.com/download).

Once the app is installed, launch it. The app will ask if you want to automatically start when the device starts up. It is recommended to select yes, unless you want to launch the app yourself every time manually.

You then will see this pairing screen:
