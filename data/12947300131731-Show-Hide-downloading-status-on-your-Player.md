Download status help you to know that change is being applied and how fast is your download speed.

Sometimes you want to disable this to have a smoother experience for your viewers.

You can do so by going to the Advanced section of Edit Screen and uncheck "Show Downloading Status".

If you have many screens, can select multiple and apply this settings to all of them.
