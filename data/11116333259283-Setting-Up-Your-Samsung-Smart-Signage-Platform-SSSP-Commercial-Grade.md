| **This article is for installing OptiSigns on Samsung SSP devices only!** |
| Your screen should be marked as "SSSP/Samsung Smart Signage Platform". Samsung has other product lines that run on Tizen OS, and aren't SSSPs. Not sure if your Samsung Smart TV is an SSP or uses Tizen OS?

## OptiSigns Installation Process

The installation process to get OptiSigns on your SSSP is easy! There are two different scenarios for you:

* **Install on a SSSP display that is already in use:** You already have SSSP display in use and would like to have OptiSigns player for SSSP deployed.
* **Install on a brand new SSSP display through out of box experience setup:** You have a brand new SSSP display or you just performed a factory reset. You can connect to OptiSigns through the out of box experience/initial set-up process.

*For a detailed visual guide for these options, please watch and follow along with our SSSP installation instructional video:*

## Limitations

Samsung SSP graphics resolution output is 1080P only. Take precaution when using 4k videos. Samsung SSP can only process a single video at any point of time. Preloading of the next video is not allowed. The transition from video to video is not as smooth as other players that allow video preloading.
