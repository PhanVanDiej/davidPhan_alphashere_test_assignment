# How to Use Animation on Templates & Designer Tool

Animation can be an effective way to display promotions, announcements, and messages, as the human eye is more likely to be drawn to moving objects, rather than static ones. With OptiSigns Designer tool you can easily add animations to your designs, bringing them to life and getting more attention from visitors.

## How To Animate Your Templates

![Screen_Shot_2021-09-16_at_10.10.19_AM.png](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/4407078784915)

1. **Design** your template or grab a prebuilt one from our extensive Template Library, then click on the element you want to animate.  
   *In this case, we will make a Halloween Promotion.*
2. Click on **Animate** in the top bar.
3. Select whether you want to make a **Page Animation** or **Object Animation.**

* **Page Animation****:** This means the contents will ***animate in an order that is placed on this list,*** back to back.  
  First, we will select the Pumpkin Hat and Pumpkin face and place them in a Page Animation with a Fade in motion. in this order:

1. 1. 1. Pumpkin Hat
      2. Pumpkin Face

This will Fade in the Pumpkin Hat first, then Fade in the Pumpkin Face like this:

* **Object Animation:** This means the content will Animate ***on the page** **regardless of the order*** they are placed in and they all animate at the same time.  
  This time will select the same Pumpkin Hat and Face and place them in a "Fly from right" motion, placing them in the Object animation list, as shown below:

This will Fly in both the Hat and the Face from the right into the picture at the same time regardless of the order, like this:

Now that we know the difference, let's make a full list of animations to the Text and the content layers of this Promotion both in Page and Object Animation:

And this is what the full Animation looks like:

## Common Issues with Animations

Now, let's go over a few common issues you may run into with your animations and our solutions!

### Preload Assets in Playlist

This feature is useful because it allows for a more seamless appearance to your playlist, since assets will be loaded prior to showing on their screen. This lessens the potential of your screen taking an extra second or two to load your assets before displaying them on your screen.

![chrome_7ffyJDhD2M.jpg](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33136472077203)

OptiSigns will preload your assets 6-8 seconds prior to the asset displaying on your screen, so your animation may be done playing by then, skipping it entirely on your screen. You can either:

* ***(Recommended)*** Add a 1-3 second delay on your animations to make sure they appear on your screen when this feature is selected:  
  ![chrome_OV36h5Ppps.jpg](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33136472095123)
* Disable Preload Assets in Playlist. However, this will show a blank screen in-between transitions.

### Device Performance

Running too many animations at once will affect your device's performance and create a less than ideal digital signage experience.

* ***(Recommended)*** Limit animations to *3 - 4 animations per template.*
