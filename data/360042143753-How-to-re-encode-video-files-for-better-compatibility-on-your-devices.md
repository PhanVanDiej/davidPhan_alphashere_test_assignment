# How to re-encode video files for better compatibility on your devices

Amazon Fire TV, Android or Roku rely on Hardware decode to decode your videos files.

Most of the time it should be OK, however, there could be times when codec is not recognized or support by your devices.

For example, here's a link to Amazon's [supported codec](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tv/device-specifications.html) or [Roku supported codec.](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/docs/specs/streaming.md)

To solve the problem you will need to convert/re-encode your video into something that Amazon, Android or Roku device support.

There's a [Handbreak is a free](https://handbrake.fr/) and very popular software to do that. It runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.

To re-encode your video.

Download, Run Handbreak.

Drag your video in there.
