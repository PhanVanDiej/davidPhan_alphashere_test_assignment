# Synchronized playback (Sync Play) feature

With OptiSigns you can enable screens to play in-sync. This means:

* If content published screens are **the same**, all screens will play the content at the same time.
* If content published screens are **different**, it will start playing them from the beginning

Supported on: Android, Fire TV, Windows, Linux, MacOS, ChromeOS, Webplayer

Note:

* When Sync Play enabled, playlists may not start from the beginning (because they are synced).
* Devices do not need to be on the same network, nor there's any special configuration needed on devices.
* Devices time need to be updated, and devices needs to be in the same time zone.
* Android, Fire TV requires updates to 5.13.7 or newer.
* Windows, Linux, MacOS, ChromeOS, and Webplayer don't have the timer server setting yet.

To use the Sync Play feature, just select the screens you want to enable this feature for.
