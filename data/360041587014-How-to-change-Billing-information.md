#### **Add/Change Tax ID**

If you are not located in the US and need a VAT invoice, you will need to maintain the VAT ID here. The Billing Address needs to be maintained first before you can maintain a Tax ID.   
Expand the Tax ID section, select the corresponding Tax ID type, and put your Tax ID here, then click the save button, and your Tax ID will be updated.
