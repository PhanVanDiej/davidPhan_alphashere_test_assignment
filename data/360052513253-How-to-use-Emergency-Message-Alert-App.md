Here are the high level steps to create & use Emergency Message App:

* Create an Emergency Message app for each situation (i.e. Fire Emergency in Building-1)
* Use a template and modify your message, or upload your own message (image, PPT, etc.)
* Select which screen or group of screens you want to be activated when this message is activated (i.e. Building-1)
* Test activation of the message - this will ensure the process is working, and the message is cached to your devices
* Use <https://emergency.optisigns.com> on your phone to activate message when required. (You can pre-login on your phone to save some time later, pre-login session lasts for 90 days)
* It takes 10-15s from the time you activate the message to the time the message displayed on the screen.

**WARNING:** active internet connection is required for emergency message to be activated on the screen (message can be pre-cached on the device, but it will still need internet to receive activation command from server). In some emergency situation, your internet connection may be impacted, so it's not recommended to use this as the sole emergency message communication in your emergency procedures.
