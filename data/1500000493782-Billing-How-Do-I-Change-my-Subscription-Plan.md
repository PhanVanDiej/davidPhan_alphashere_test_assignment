# Billing: How Do I Change my Subscription Plan?

### In this article, we will cover how to change the subscription plan on your OptiSigns account.

* [From Free Trial](#Trial)
* [From Existing Paid Subscription](#Existing)

It's extremely easy to change the details of your OptiSigns subscription. From the type of plan you're using, to the number of screens associated with the account, to the add-on licenses you've purchased, all of this can be managed on the Subscription Plan screen.

In addition, you can change payment terms from Monthly to Yearly and vice versa. Our billing system will prorate your charges as appropriate.

#### **To make changes to your plan, please go to:**

Currently (as of late 2024), we offer two terms:

* **Monthly:** A straight fee, paid each month. The most basic subscription type.
* **Yearly:** A commitment to pay for a single screen for a year, but with a 10% discount.

Choose whichever you prefer, then hit **Next**.

You'll be asked to input your payment information. Do so, then hit **Update subscription**.

Once that's done, you'll see an itemized breakdown, showing your plan, the number of screens, the Subtotal, the amount paid in Sales Tax (varies by location), and an estimate for your next bill.
