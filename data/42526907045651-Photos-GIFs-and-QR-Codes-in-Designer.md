### Crop

![crop button graphic](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526890575507)

The **Crop** option allows you to crop the selected photo or image.

![crop feature example](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526890576019)

The crop area can be dragged, expanded, and retracted, with **Aspect Ratio** options and the ability to flip and rotate the image. A preview of the cropped image is present in the upper right of the screen, and the size of the image is indicated. Lastly, the crop area can be changed to be a **Rectangle** or **Circle.**

### Mask

![mask button graphic](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526906958099)

Clicking the **Mask** option will open up the Mask option on the **Side Menu**.

![mask feature example](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526906960531)

Selecting a Shape from the Mask menu will automatically apply a mask of that shape to the image. The image can still be moved once the mask is applied.

Clicking **Edit Mask** will allow you to move the mask itself around the image. Clicking **Invert** will swap the areas being masked. Clicking **Apply Mask** will reapply the mask on the image.

### Replace

![replace button graphic](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526890578963)

The **Replace** option lets you replace the image or photo with an image off the current device. This can be accessed via the Top Menu, or the quick action bar:

### Background Remover

![background remover button graphic](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526906962067)

The **Background Remover** option automatically detects and removes backgrounds from images. Currently, it only supports auto-removal and it is not possible to custom erase or restore the background.

![background remover example](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526890579859)

You’ll need to wait for a loading icon to finish:

![background remover loading graphic](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526906963091)

Once done, click **Save**, and the background will have disappeared.

### Link

![link button graphic](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526906963987)

Selecting the **Link** option lets you turn your photo or image into an interactive element, mostly used for kiosks. It will open the **Link Options** section on the Left Navbar:

![link options side menu](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526906964499)

Clicking **Add Link** will prompt you to enter a URL or select an asset:

![select asset screen](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526906964627)

Once a link or asset has been chosen, more options will appear in the Link Options section:

![link options full options](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526890584723)

Expanding the **Scale** section will provide this option for your asset:

![scale options](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526890585491)

Here, choose how the image will be scaled. There are three options:

* **Fit (default)** - Fits the image to the screen.
* **Stretch** - Stretches the image to fill the entire screen.
* **Zoom** - Zooms in on the image to fill up the entire screen. Not recommended for small images on large displays, as this will create blurriness.

|  |
| --- |
| **NOTE** |
| If a URL is provided, the **Scale** option will not appear. |

Expanding the **Settings** section will provide these options for your link:

![settings options](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526890586131)

* **Duration (seconds) -** When the link is clicked or tapped, how long the link or asset will display before returning to the main design. This starts from the last touch on the screen or time the link was clicked.
* **Preload** **-** When checked, the website will load when the design does. This reduces the amount of time it takes for the website to pop up when the link is clicked. However, having numerous links needing to load may cause lag.

Expanding the **Close & Nav Bar Styler** section will provide these options for your link:

![close & nav bar styler options](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526890586771)

This section refers to the button that will appear on your screens when it is pushed to them. Clicking or tapping this button will return you back to the original design.

![icon](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42526906967699)

* **Icon Position -** Shows where this icon will appear. Defaults toBottom Center, but can be placed anywhere along the top or bottom, or turned off entirely.
