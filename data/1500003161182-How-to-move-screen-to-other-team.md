Then you can select which team you want to move to.

That's it. Your screen will move to the specific team.

Note:

Sometimes it will pop out an error message "**You have reached the maximum number of screens for your team, to continue adding more screens, please update a number of screens limit of your team.**"

It means you need to update the **Number of screens limit** for your team.

1. You can go to the Account Members.
