If you select "Create New", you can accept the default 1920x1080 width & height, or if your need to create portrait notice board, you can change to 1080x1920.

From here on, the Editor is pretty much similar to PowerPoint or Google Slides, you can just click on objects to move it, edit text, adding pictures, draw shape etc.
