#### **Batch installation from the server URL with settings from a USB drive:**

Instead of typing in the URL and change settings for reach device, you can create USB drive to re-use it on many screens.  
1) Create a file named ‘scap\_installation.json’ on your computer with this content:

```
   
{  
“serverIp” : “0.0.0.0”,  
“serverPort” : 0,  
“secureConnection” : false,  
“fqdnMode” : true,  
“fqdnAddr” : “https://links.optisigns.com/lg”,  
“appLaunchMode” : “local”,  
“appType” : “ipk”  
}
```

2) Copy this file into the root of the USB drive   
3) Insert the USB drive into the device and start/reboot it  
4) Once the installation finish, restart the TV and OptiSigns app will AutoStart.

**To check which LG WebOS Signage firmware version is installed on the device:**   
Enter the settings menu (the config wheel icon on the remote)   
Navigate to ‘General’ -> ‘System Information’

#### **To upgrade the** **LG WebOS Signage firmware** **on the device:**

If you are running WebOs 4.1 or older, you may need to upgrade your Firmware to for the device to be able to play optisigns apps like Weather, Social Medias, etc.  
Get the latest firmware file (.epk) from [LG website](https://webossignage.developer.lge.com/firmware/firmware-download/downloading-firmware/) (please contact us or LG if you need help)

Insert the USB drive into the TV's USB port  
The update menu will automatically appear   
Click on ‘Update’ and wait till the process finishes

You can create USB drive config to replicate settings from 1 device to another (include WiFi, OptiSigns app, time zone, etc.) this will save you time if you have many devices to set up.

Enter the settings menu (the config wheel icon on the remote)  
Insert a USB drive into your device
