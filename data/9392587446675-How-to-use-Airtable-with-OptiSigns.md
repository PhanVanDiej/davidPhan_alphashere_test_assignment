* Name: for you to remember, you can use the same Airtable name.
* Embed: Paste in your Embed Code.
* Update Interval: Default is 600 seconds (10 minutes). This mean the app will refresh the link every 10 mins for any changes in your Airtable. If you have a lot of slides, you may want to change this interval to something longer.
