Then go to Vimeo, find the video you like to copy the link

Then Paste the link to OptiSigns' Vimeo app.  
You don't have to enter the video name, the app will automatically get the official name of the video from Vimeo.

You then can use this Vimeo video on your playlist or assign directly to screen if you'd like.

**Note**: If you want to set your Vimeo as not public, you can set your Viemo as "**Hide from Vimeo".** Then you can add "[social-player.optisigns.com](http://social-player.optisigns.com/)" in the Specific domains of Embed.
