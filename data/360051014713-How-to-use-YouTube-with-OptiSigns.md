* **Name**: Give your YouTube video a name. This is for displaying in your asset list only. The app will try to get the video's title and use as name, but you can change it to something else.
* **URL**: Paste the link to your YouTube video here. This should be the actual URL, not the Share link:

* **Caption**: If the YouTube video has closed caption, the app will show it. Note: closed caption must be created by the YouTube video author, auto generated caption may not work.

Click Save.  
After Saving, you can Preview the video to verify.

## **That's all! Congratulations!**
